# The VBA of Wall Street

Created a script in VBA used to manipulate data related to ticker prices and volume. After running the FinalScript in VBA, the data is condensed and is organized to show information for each individual ticker on each worksheet.
There is a column designated for Ticker symbol, Yearly Change, Percent Change and Total Stock Volume. I found it easier to run scripts for each sheet individually to see if it works properly before running it on all scripts at once.

    Please view the FinalScript, to see results for all worsheets at once.

There is also script for:

Ticker

Volume

Percent Change
