# The VBA of Wall Street

Created a script in VBA used to manipulate data for Multi Year Stock (2014 - 2016). After running the FinalScript in VBA, the data is condensed and is organized to show information for each individual ticker on each worksheet.

There is a column designated for Ticker symbol, Yearly Change, Percent Change and Total Stock Volume. I found it easier to run scripts for each sheet individually on aplhabetical_testing.xlsm to see if it works properly before running it on all sheets at once. The results for Multi Year Stock Data are shown on the three screenshots, 2014 - 2016.PNG.

    Please view FinalScript.bas, to run the results for all worsheets at once.

There is also script for:

Ticker

Volume

Percent Change
